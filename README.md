# Journey
Journey is a physics-based realistic game that takes inspiration from the Worldâ€™s Hardest Game and Run 3. As a tribute to the retirement of Adobe Flash Player, we wanted to create a game that reminded players of classic internet "rage" games using an updated game engine. We used realistic graphics and processing effects like reflections and surface imperfections to give the game a unique, otherworldly look. Code for the game was built around the "PlayerMovement" script (found at Assets/Scripts/MainScripts/PlayerMovement.cs) which changes the world's gravity, manages the shields and levels, plays sound effects, and controls the camera. Other secondary scripts changed the enemies' mesh to create a fluid-like look. The game can be played online at: https://noahschwartz.itch.io/journey.
